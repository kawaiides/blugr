1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,099
The USA is the largest and most influential economy to have ever existed in human history.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,660
For over a century, it has dominated the world.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,280
More wealth has been credited here in just the last 20 years and the entire world

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,800
credit between 1 and 1,700 IED.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,359
But the question is, why?

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,379
Capital moved faster.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,299
Once you get a dominant position in the currency, it's very difficult to lose it.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,679
Immigration and innovation.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,060
The US financial markets are the deepest, broadest, biggest markets in the world.

10
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,780
I haven't yet to meet a person on Wall Street who can operate on somebody's brain.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,280
The economics-explaning team traveled across the world to try and answer this one simple question.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,320
We sat down with some of the brightest minds in economics, finance and policy to find out.

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,040
I came to Wall Street because I had no money growing up as a kid and I wanted to get rich.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,359
The USA isn't the largest country in the world.

15
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,719
It doesn't have the most resources or the most manpower.

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,859
So what was it's secret?

17
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,939
The wealth has been concentrated with a very small percentage.

18
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:23,719
The United States is able to allocate resources in a way which gives the United States a significant advantage.

19
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,680
This is a culture of risk takers.

20
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,480
One of the reasons that the US has stronger trend growth, we allow more migrants in.

21
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,719
Does this all work when the US has to share the global spotlight with arrival?

22
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,319
And what happens if the American Empire stops working for the American people?

23
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,019
The United States is able to work for the American people.

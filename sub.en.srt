Get ready to be amazed. 

6 
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,480 
Forget the image of cavemen hitting rocks together. 

7 
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,060 
Stone Age tools evolved dramatically over millions of years. 

8 
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,320 
From simple choppers to finally, crafted hand axes, the ingenuity of our ancestors will 

9 
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,860 
stand you. 

10 
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880 
Homo have a leaves, Homo recticych species left a unique mark in the technological landscape 

11 
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240

The Stone Age wasn't just about hunting and gathering. 

14 
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,160 
Around 12,000 years ago, something incredible happened, the neolithic revolution. 

15 
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,300 
Humans learned to farm, leading to settled villages, the domestication of animals like sheep 

16 
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,500 
and goats, and the creation of the first pottery and woven fabrics. 

17 
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:0,760 
Suddenly, life was less about constant wandering and more about building-masting communities 

18 
00:01:0,760 --> 00:01:3,360 
and cultivating the land-atoning point in human history. 

19 
00:01:4,080 --> 00:01:6,100 
Think the Stone Age was all about bare necessities. 

20

22 
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,580 
suggesting complex thought and belief systems. 

23 
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,800 
From cave paintings, the painting animals to the earliest forms of burial rituals, 

24 
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,300 
the evidence of creativity and spiritual expression is undeniable. 

25 
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,560 
It paints a vibrant picture of the human spirit far beyond simply surviving. 

26 
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,760 
The Stone Age eventually gave way to the bronze on nine ages as human's massive metallurgy. 

27 
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,340 
But even today, the legacy of the Stone Age remains profound.

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,120
